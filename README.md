## Tasks
### How to submit tasks? 
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using *git clone*.
2. Create a new branch to work on your changes using *git branch <branch-name>*.
3. Make changes to the code and commit those changes to your local branch using *git commit*.
4. Push your local branch to your forked repository on GitHub using *git push*.
5. Create a pull request (PR) from your branch in your forked repository to the main repository you are working on.
6. When naming your branch, include your name or username in the branch name to avoid conflicts. For example, you could use a naming convention like *username:feature/feature-name* or *username:bugfix/bugfix-name*.
